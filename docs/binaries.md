## Versioning

CMZLoader follows does **not** follow Semantic Versioning, and is instead more
of an explicit system. Most importantly, this system will **remain consistent**
throughout the lifespan of CMZLoader.

CMZLoader itself uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD` scheme. The first three version
numbers will try to follow the rules of SemVer 2.0, where:

> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,

> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and

> PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

`BUILD` represents an internal build number, and is only there for currently undefined,
but possibly future use.

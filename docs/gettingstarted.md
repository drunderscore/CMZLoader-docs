To begin, you need the following skills:

- Knowledge of C# (or some other .NET language)
- Good reverse engineering skills
- Patience

...and the following tools:

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [XNA 4.0 **Framework** Redistributable ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=20914)
- A copy of [CMZLoader binaries](/binaries)

## Creating & Preparing the Project

In Visual Studio, you must create the project from the template _"Class Library (.NET Framework)"_
for a .dll in your .NET language of choice.

Once the solution and project have been created, you must now add CMZLoader and XNA references.
You can right-click the project and go to `Add > Reference...`. Browse to your CastleMinerZ
directory that has CMZLoader installed, and select the following files (multiple by Ctrl + Click):

- `CastleMinerZ.exe`
- `DNA.Common.dll`
- `DNA.Steam.dll`
- `Services.Client.dll`

Once those have been added, traverse to the `Assemblies` tab of the reference manager, and search for `XNA`.
If nothing shows up, you **may not have installed the XNA Framework correctly.**

You can select all of the XNA Frameworks if you wish, but the ones you should always have are:

- `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll`
- `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dll`
- `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.dll`
- `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Xact.dll`

Be sure to click 'OK' upon finishing with the dialog. You should now have **successfully referenced all necessary assemblies.**

## Beginning Your Mod

The name and version of your mod is controlled by it's assembly attributes. These are usually pre-generated
for you, inside `AssemblyInfo.cs` (usually in the `Properties` tab). You can edit these to your liking,
however you should know what impact the following attributes have on your mod:

- `AssemblyTitleAttribute`: Controls the display name of your mod.
- `AssemblyVersionAttribute`: Controls the version of your mod.

_Example:_

```c# hl_lines="1 12"
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("Cool Docs")]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("Cool Docs")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright Â© James Puleo 2020")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]
[assembly: Guid("10e20dec-0429-4412-add0-9c6a98430230")]

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]
```

Your mod is **required** to have **one class** that inherits the `Mod` class from CMZLoader.
This alone is enough to have your mod shown in the mod list.

_Example:_

```c#
namespace CoolDocs {
    public class CoolDocsMod : Mod {
        // ...
    }
}
```

By default, mods are compatible with vanilla players, and aren't required on the
host or connecting clients. However, some mods may have certain aspects that won't work without all
clients having the mod. In these instances, it may be beneficial to mark your mod as **required**
with the `ModRequiredAttribute`.

Hosts that have a required mod will not accept clients that do not also have the mod. Likewise,
clients with a required mod cannot join hosts who do not also have the mod. Those users will
be disconnected with either a _"Mod missing on server"_ or _"Mod missing on client"_ connection error.

Mods that add things such as items, blocks, custom biomes,
or network messages, or change core game features, like damage or spawning, should always be marked
as required.

_Example:_

```c# hl_lines="2"
namespace CoolDocs {
    [ModRequired]
    public class CoolDocsMod : Mod {
        // ...
    }
}
```

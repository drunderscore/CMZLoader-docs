## What is CMZLoader?

CMZLoader is an API and loader for CastleMiner Z, that allows for easy installation and great compatibility between multiple mods.
No longer will your users have difficulties due to old mods!

## Where am I?

You are currently on the **developer documentation**, which is meant for mod creators.

If you took a wrong turn somewhere, that's okay, there is still hope! You can check out the [CastleMiner Discord server](https://discord.gg/wde7fFB)
to get some help with installing mods, troubleshooting issues, or finding new mods!

## Issue Reports

Due to the source code being private, you can report any possible issues you have found with the loader on the
docs repository [here](https://github.com/drunderscore/CMZLoader-docs).

## .NET Language Choice

You have free rein to choose the .NET language to your liking. However, it will be assumed that **you are using C#.**
Most code examples will not be offered in any other language.
